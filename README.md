# Introduction
This game was made for the Nokia 3310 Jam 6. Where it has to fit with the
restrictions of the original 3310 phone from the 2000s. I had 10 days to 
finish the game. This was the first Game Jam I ever participated in so I'm
kinda excited.

Now the game itself will be written in C++. I will also be using the
raylib library as well. The optional theme of the Game Jam is: "FREEZE",
and I choosing to base the game behind that.


# Game Ideas
Heres a collection I many ideas I came up with. Who knows, maybe they will
be used in future games. While trying to think of ideas, I'm working with
the restrictions that it's a game for the NOKIA 3310. The game shouldn't
be that complicated.

## Red Light, Green Light.
One idea that instantly entered my head is making the game based around
Red Light, Green Light. I saw memes about it which is why I had the idea
in the first place.

## Bullet Hell
Another idea is that I could have the player be in an area and bullets
will be flying about. The amount of bullets would be ludicrous and the
player itself would have slippery controls.

Luckily, the player has the ability to **FREEZE** time during of which,
they would have full precise movement.

## Enemy Stand!
Maybe instead of the player having the ability to freeze time, why not
give that ability to the antagonist? Although, something like that
probably would've been too complicated to program in 10 days. It's an 
interesting idea so I'll shelf it for future games.

## Samurai Kirby
I could have the game be reaction based with you have to press a button
at the right time. 

## Slippery Platformer
Now hear me out, what if I made a platformer where the ice is super 
slippery, the player has to work around that and use it to their
advantage?


# Game Concept
With the help of some people on discord, I finally figured out what the 
game would be. It's based on the last idea in the previous section.

So basically, the game is gonna be a platformer where you'd have to get
to the end of the level. The game is gonna take place in a cold setting
so because of that, you'd have a limited amount of time before you freeze
to death.

On top of that the floor would be slippery which makes getting to the
end of the level more tricky. There would be campfiles that act as
checkpoints, and it raises your temperature when standing near it.

The story could be that you're stuck in a restaurant's freezer and you
must escape before freezing to death. There could also be hazards the 
decrease the player's temperature at a faster rate.


# After Thoughts
It's been a while since I last updated this. I've finished the game and it
functions alright. It's not the best, but I just wanted to get something
done, and learn more about C++

It was a fun side project though. The reason why I decided to participate
in this GameJam is to hopefully get my name out there and encourage people
to check out my main project. If you're reading this, thanks for playing!
