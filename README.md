# Introduction
This game was made for the Nokia 3310 Jam 6. Where it has to fit with the
restrictions of the original 3310 phone from the 2000s. I had 10 days to 
finish the game. This was the first Game Jam I ever participated in so I'm
kinda excited.

Now the game itself will be written in C++. I will also be using the
raylib library as well. The optional theme of the Game Jam is: "FREEZE",
and I choosing to base the game behind that.


# Game Ideas
Heres a collection I many ideas I came up with. Who knows, maybe they will
be used in future games.

## Red Light, Green Light.
One idea that instantly entered my head is making the game based around
Red Light, Green Light. I saw memes about it which is why I had the idea
in the first place.

## Bullet Hell
Another idea is that I could have the player be in an area and bullets
will be flying about. The amount of bullets would be ludicrous and the
player itself would have slippery controls.

Luckily, the player has the ability to **FREEZE** time during of which,
they would have full precise movement.

## Enemy Stand!
Maybe instead of the player having the ability to freeze time, why not
give that ability to the antagonist? Although, something like that
probably would've been too complicated to program in 10 days. It's an 
interesting idea so I'll shelf it for future games.

## Samurai Kirby
I could have the game be reaction based with you have to press a button
at the right time.
